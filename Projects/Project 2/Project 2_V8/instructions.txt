Welcome to a game of Mastermind!

Mastermind is a code breaking game for users to try and guess four different 
colors the computer picked by random. The user uses hints given by the computer
telling them whether their color is in the right spot, or how many of the colors 
are correct. The user inputs how any attempts they are willing to play, and to win
they must guess the correct colors before 
10 tries. 

Please pick four colors and press enter to continue. You must write
out the full color name to pick that color. After you write out the
color the computer will ask you for the spot number. This means what
spot do you want your color to go in(first,second,third,fourth)
you will input this as either one of the four numbers (1,2,3,4).
The available colors are red, green, blue, yellow, brown, orange,
black, and white.The computer might does not pick any color more than
once. If you can guess in 10 tries or less, you win. 
Your colors will be displayed in a table as single characters as:
red= r, green=g, blue=b, brown=n, black=k,
yellow=y, orange=o, and white = w.
