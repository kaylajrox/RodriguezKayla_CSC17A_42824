 * Gaddis_8thEd_Chap12_Prob11
 Problem 11:  
  Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data on 
  a company division:    
  Division Name (such as East, West, North, or South)  
  Quarter (1, 2, 3, or 4)    
  Quarterly Sales   
  The user should be asked for the four quartersâ€™ sales figures for the East, 
  West, North, and South divisions. The data for each quarter for each division 
  should be written to a file. Input Validation: Do not accept negative 
  numbers for any sales figures.     */
