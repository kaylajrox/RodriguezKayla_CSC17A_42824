 * Title: Average Number of Letters
 * Problem: Gaddis_8thEd_Chap10_Prob4
 *
    Problem 3:
  Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and
  returns the number of words contained in the string. For instance, if the
  string argument is “Four score and seven years ago” the function should return
  the number 6. Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user to
  input a string and then passes it to the function. The number of words in the
  string should be displayed on the screen. Optional Exercise: Write an
  overloaded version of this function that accepts a string class object
   as its argument.
    Problem 4:
  Modify the program you wrote for Problem 3 (Word Counter), so it also
  displays the average number of letters in each word.
