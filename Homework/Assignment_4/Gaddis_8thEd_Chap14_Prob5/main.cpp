/*Problem: 
Design a class named TimeOff. The purpose of the class is to track an employee’s
sick leave, vacation, and unpaid time off. It should have, as members, the following
instances of the NumDays class described in Programming Challenge 4:
maxSickDays A NumDays object that records the maximum number of days of
sick leave the employee may take.
sickTaken A NumDays object that records the number of days of sick leave the
employee has already taken.
maxVacation A NumDays object that records the maximum number of days of
paid vacation the employee may take.
vacTaken A NumDays object that records the number of days of paid vacation
the employee has already taken.
Programming Challenges 885
maxUnpaid A NumDays object that records the maximum number of days of
unpaid vacation the employee may take.
unpaidTaken A NumDays object that records the number of days of unpaid leave
the employee has taken.
Additionally, the class should have members for holding the employee’s name and 
identification
number. It should have an appropriate constructor and member functions for
storing and retrieving data in any of the member objects.
Input Validation: Company policy states that an employee may not accumulate more
than 240 hours of paid vacation. The class should not allow the maxVacation object
to store a value greater than this amount.*/
