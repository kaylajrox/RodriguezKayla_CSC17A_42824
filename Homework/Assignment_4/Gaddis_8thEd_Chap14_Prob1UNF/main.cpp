/*Problem:  Design a class  Numbers  that can be used to translate whole dollar 
 * amounts in the range 0 through 9999 into an English description of the number.
 *  For example, the number 713 would be translated into the string  seven 
 * hundred thirteen , and 8203 would be translated into  eight thousand two 
 * hundred three . The class should have a single integer member variable: 
   int number;   and a static array of  string  objects that specify how to 
 * translate key dollar amounts into the desired format. For example, you might 
 * use static strings such as 
   string lessThan20[20] = {"zero", "one", ..., "eighteen", "nineteen"}; 
 * string hundred = "hundred";  
 * string thousand = "thousand";   T
 * he class should have a constructor that accepts a nonnegative integer and 
 * uses it to initialize the  Numbers  object. It should have a member function
 *   print()  that prints the English description of the  Numbers  object. 
 * Demonstrate the class by writing a main program that asks the user to enter a 
 * number in the proper range and then prints out its English description.  */
