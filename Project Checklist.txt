9 -> Pointers/Dyn Memory 
10 -> Strings/Character Arrays
11 -> Structures
12 -> Binary Files
13 -> Classes
14 -> Classes++
15 -> Inheritance/Polymorphism
16 -> Templates

Objective: Dynamic array of Templated objects created from abstract base class using derived children
-pointers to create dynamic arrays
-pointer and array notation
-templated arrays
-structures, structures that point to structures
-.read and .write for binary files** (I did this wrong last time)
- do not need to see friends
-overloaded operators
-break up the class into inherited , inherited derived
-vectors can be used with anything
-templates can be used with anything (templated functions and templated classes)
-structures with pointers 
-final will contain pieces of this







Directions on blackboard:
Make sure you create a folder in Github so I can see the progress over time.  I am to be a collaborator so I can check your progress.  
You are to create a folder inside of this repository called Project 2.  In the folder you will place the work you have done with respect 
to Project 2 up to this point and/or if you haven't started you will place Project 1 which will be modified to become Project 2.  I will 
keep track of your progress over the coming weeks.

Refer, to the Project 1 writeup and examples of previous students submissions. Also, send me an email attaching the writeup and the 
program to mark.lehr@rcc.edu with the subject LastName,FirstName - Project 2 - 42824

Make sure to include concepts for Chapters 9 to 16.  To make sure you don't exclude anything provide a checklist of those concepts that 
should be included vs. what you actually included.

Minimum Line count = 1000

Writeup has the same requirements as the first project.

Document using doxygen, gliffy, and UML diagrams.
