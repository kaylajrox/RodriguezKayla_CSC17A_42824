Lecture Notes 3/7/2016 POINTERS

Why do we use pointers?
to allocate memory
to "create memory on the fly"
you would like a program's input be as small as possible
you may need more memory than what you started with
*Allocating memory is important
you must return things correctly or you will create leaks
memory that isnt deallocated causes a leak
needs to clean up after yourself and memory starts to shrink
dont mix the array and pointer notation
you can only return pointers
