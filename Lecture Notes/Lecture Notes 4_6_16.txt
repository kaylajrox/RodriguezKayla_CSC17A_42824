                          24 bits
 H1     H2       H3       H4      H5       H6      H7     H8 
->hex is every four bits
->this is the representation of a float

What was largest factorial you could put for 3 bits?
7 was largest,
3! was largest you could do

cout the answer for 5 and 6, you do not have a write a program that does it
-you could bound the answer, value has to be between certain values

What have we covered?
-all notation and dynamic allocation applies to classes
-dynamicly allocate the same way


Questions/Concerns on Midterm
-Make sure to understand conversions
-Why do i have to dynamically allocate this one when i declared the size at the top?
-Is there a way to dynamically allocate without asking the user the size?
An alternative way to write this program by putting it in a structure:
 SEE MIDTERM PROB 1 AND 2
-Do i use const in my structure questions??
-a way to put functions in a structure.....

Chapter 13: Introduction to Classes
-already know everything about notation and dynamic allocation
-before classes, two ways to program:
->Procedural programming
->object-oriented programming-makes program more efficient
-data hiding

-you can utlitize a class the same way as a structure
-the data elements in a class should be private--> not allowed in there

-you need to know termnology
