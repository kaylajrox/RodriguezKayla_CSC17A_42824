with a templates, you have to put the specification and the implication in the same file !! 
**Everything must be in the same file for templates!!**
You have to put a template before every function its used

but with classes thats our difference between .cpp(implication) and .h(specification)


-You should never use built in arrays if you already know classes because these classes already 
clean up after themselves
-You need to be able to use legacy code
-we have to write your own vectors because the other ones have extra stuff
-simplest templated class (need to know for 17C)
-built into the vector is the size, push_back function which allows you to add elements into the vector
-allocates a new array and copies all the contents from the previous array into this new allocated memory, this is what push_back does to add just that one element
-pop_back function shrinks the vector, to deallocate the memory

What is the use of templates?
