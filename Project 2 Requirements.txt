 Memory allocation

     Functions with structures, used as input and output

     Pointers with arrays and arrays of structures, internally as well as externally.

     Use of character arrays as well as string objects.

     Reading and wrting to binary files.

Basically anything in Chapters 9 to 12 from Gaddis.

Also, use doxygen to document your code in addition to flowcharting.

Questions: 
What is doxygen?
I want computer to not to pick duplicate colors


Layout:
struct for color picks -
memory allocation for how many turns -
I want to take what is inputted as string and have the Computer change it into a single character -
I want to put the colors in the spots that the user entered **STILL NEED TO DO THIS**
Holds each turn into an array->this will be used for memory allocation (possibly did this)
possibly add another class with static variables for the leaderboard **STILL NEED TO DO THIS**

if statement for spots??
change the order of which they are inputting with the spot in place

questions:
 /*CHECK VALIDATIONS
  -toupper validation for strings
  -output the spot number for computer?
  * I need to validate that they only pick the colors from the given list
  * want to convert these strings to characters
  * Missing any requirements? 
  */
When I put the write file calculations into a function it no longer works
I am curious as to why it does not work
